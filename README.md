# QTM350 Final Project
This is our team's work for the final project for QTM 350 (Spring '21)

By: Laura Neff, Jason Hamilton, Jason Perelman, and Chris Nicholson

In this project, we will collect written movie reviews, perform sentiment analysis using [AWS Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/), and then analyze Comprehend's accuracy using a variety of statistical techniques. We will be using two different corpora of movie reviews specifically designed for sentiment analysis projects: 1) the Cornell Movie Reviews Database, which includes 5,006 movie reviews and ratings (0-1) by four different authors, and 2) the Rotten Tomatoes Movies and Critic Reviews dataset, which includes 1,130,017 reviews with "fresh"/"rotten" ratings of 17,712 movies, of which 824,081 reviews contain subjective review scores (e.g. 3/5, B+, etc.). Our code for reproducible results can be found [here](https://github.com/jperelm/QTM350FinalProject/blob/main/Final%20Project.ipynb) and our blog post explaining our analysis can be found [here](http://ricottablogpost.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).
